# R Shiny App For Customer Segmentation

<h2>Description</h2>
Customer segmentation is the process of dividing a broad consumer or business market, normally consisting of existing and potential customers, into sub-groups up based on common characteristics â€“ such as demographics or behaviors, so your marketing team or sales team can reach out to those customers more effectively.

This project demonstrates how R Shiny Apps may be used to automate customer segmentation using advanced clustering algorithms such as K-means.
