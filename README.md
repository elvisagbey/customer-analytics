# R Shiny App For Customer Segmentation

<h2>Description</h2>
Customer segmentation is the process of dividing a broad consumer or business market, normally consisting of existing and potential customers, into sub-groups up based on common characteristics – such as demographics or behaviors, so your marketing team or sales team can reach out to those customers more effectively.
<br></br>
This project demonstrates how R Shiny Apps may be used to automate customer segmentation using advanced clustering algorithms such as K-means.

<h2>Languages and Utilities Used</h2>

1. [Install R and RStudio](https://techvidvan.com/tutorials/install-r/)
 
2. Clone the project: Run this from the command line
 
 ```commandline
 git clone https://github.com/graphshade/Customer-segmentation---R-Shiny-App.git
 ```
 
3. Install Required Libraries Using Virtual Environment: 
   
   You may install the libraries directly on your computer however, using the virtual environment library `renv`. [Follow this guide to install renv](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc7ZB4F_dc0)
   1. Open the app.R file in RStudio
   2. In the RStudio console run `renv::init()` to initiate the renv virtual environment and install the required libraries from the [renv.lock](https://github.com/graphshade/Customer-segmentation---R-Shiny-App/blob/master/renv.lock) file 

4. Run the app
 From the left corner of your RStudio, click on <kbd> <br> Run App <br>
